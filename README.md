# Program Title (edit this)
 
You are the Dad, and your goal is to find dinner for your family.  Travel and survive through multiple levels in search of food.   Levels have different objectives. For most levels, the objective is to get to the other side of the map to advance to the next level. However, some levels require you to select the correct in-game decisions to advance to the next level, and the final level requires you to defeat the boss, Joe Ham.  

There are 2 level types: 2D left-to-right platformers, and up/down/left/right free movement levels.

There is no scoring criteria, the only thing to do is advance to the next level.  But there are many unexpected ways to die/lose. The point of the game is trial and error until you find out how to win!!!

The controls vary on the level.  Some levels use the regular WASD keys for movement, as well as 1/2 buttons for option selection and ALT to reset/advance levels.  Whereas over levels use the L and R letter keys for left/right movement, BACKSPACE for jumping, and also use the ENTER key to restart the level after dying (the keys are purposely annoying/unconventional to suit the theme of this game).  The final level also allows holding the SHIFT button with the L/R keys to sprint.

Additionally, there is mouse input in some of the levels as well.  Certain actions can be done through pressing the mouse, hovering the cursor over a certain area, or both at the same time.

Limitations: Not every level allows up/down movement, jumping, sprinting, or mouse input.  You cannot select which level to play (there is no menu), you must advance through them in the correct order.  The game cannot restart from the beginning of the game, it can only restart at the beginning of the level after dying.
